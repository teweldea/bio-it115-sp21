My name is Tewelde Abraha, and I'm a student at Seattle Central College studying application development. I live in Bouelvard Park, Washington, and I love the world of tech. In addition, I have my Bachelor's of Arts degree in American Ethnic Studies. 

As of recently include learning skills through the Adobe Suite. I also really enjoy reading, exercising, and investing. 

I love being apart of work that is bigger than myself. I am a willing learner who wishes not only want to be an asset to any project that I am apart of, but to also be a symbol of hope in Eritrean-American, and White Center Community. 

Iâ€™d love to virtually grab some coffee if you want to talk about programming, designing, books, or any of your own interests.
